# Recipe Book Application

## Overview

The Recipe Book Application is a simple web tool that allows users to create and view a collection of recipes by inputting recipe names and their ingredients.

## How I Built It

1. **HTML Structure**: Created a basic layout with input fields for the recipe name and ingredients, along with a submission button.
2. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Implemented event listeners for user interactions, capturing input when the button is clicked.
   - Added validation to ensure both fields are filled before submission.
   - Used DOM manipulation to display the entered recipes in a formatted manner.
3. **Styling**: Basic styling using CSS was applied to enhance visual clarity and usability.
