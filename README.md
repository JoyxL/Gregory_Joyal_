# Recipe Book Application - OOP Integration

## Overview

The Recipe Book application utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure the code effectively and enhance code maintenance and scalability. By organizing functionality into reusable classes, the application becomes more modular, making it easier to expand and manage in the future.

## **Classes and Their Responsibilities**

### **Recipe Class**
**Purpose**: The Recipe class represents a single recipe, encapsulating its properties and behaviors.

**Properties:**
- `name`: A string that holds the name of the recipe.
- `ingredients`: An array of strings representing the ingredients required for the recipe.

**Constructor**: Initializes a new instance of the Recipe class with a specified name and ingredients list.

## **How We Built It**

1. **HTML Structure**: Created a basic layout with input fields for the recipe name and ingredients, along with a submission button.
2. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Implemented event listeners for user interactions, capturing input when the button is clicked.
   - Added validation to ensure both fields are filled before submission.
   - Used DOM manipulation to display the entered recipes in a formatted manner.
3. **Styling**: Basic styling using CSS was applied to enhance visual clarity and usability.
